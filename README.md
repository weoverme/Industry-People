# Industry:People
## A project that aims to give hope to people looking for a starting point to their career.

People in each industry of the social economy today are using the same technology in different ways for different purposes. Some use different technology in different ways for the same purpose. 

It seems like there is a fine line between what I do versus what other people do, but look at the line from the side or another perspective, and that line may have a different shape; the line may now have an odd shape, a wide wall or even block vision. 

Tell us what you do and how you came to be. How do YOU make a difference in your industry?
