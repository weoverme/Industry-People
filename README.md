# Industry:People
## A project that aims to give hope to people looking for a starting point to their career.

People in each industry of the social economy today are using the same technology in different ways for different purposes. Some use different technology in different ways for the same purpose. 

It seems like there is a fine line between what I do versus what other people do, but look at the line from the side or another perspective, and that line may have a different shape; the line may now have an odd shape, a wide wall or even block vision. 

### Problem Statement: 
The society we live in has MANY industries using various technology in various ways to achieve a common goal - to build a future for themselves. Many young students, university students, and even people in the workforce don't really know and understand what it is they want to do, nor know what is out there and is available for them to apply skills and knowledge they paid for in their respective educational institues. 

### My Attempt at solving the issue: 
1. Gather information and understand what (kind of) jobs are available in each industry, by using the survey I prepared - https://forms.gle/HG7LknJJj3XwewzK9
2. Understand what it is they do their industry/field of industry.
3. Understand how it adds value to their industry/field of industry.
4. Collate the information and present the complex data in a simple method.
